## Portals4 GNU UPC User Manual
The GNU UPC for Portals 4.0 (Portals4, Portals) is an implementation of  GNU UPC that uses Portals interface for message passing between UPC threads running on separate nodes in a system area network. [READ](https://github.com/Intrepid/GUPC/blob/master/Documentation/portals4-upc-user-manual.pdf).

## UPC Runtime Design Utilizing Portals-4
This document describes the design of a UPC runtime, which implements UPC (Unified Parallel C) semantics, and that makes use of the functions and operations provided by the Portals-4 API (Application Programming Interface). The Portals-4 operations are used primarily to implement access to remote computing nodes across a high-speed network. [READ](portals4-upc-runtime-design.pdf).

## GCC/UPC 4.0 Flexible Heap Design Overview
The GCC/UPC 4.0 runtime implements a facility known as a “flexible heap”. The flexible heap facility removes the need for the user to specify the maximum amount of memory required for allocation from the UPC language defined heap facility.
