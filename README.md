# GNU Unified Parallel C (GNU UPC)
The GNU UPC toolset provides a compilation and execution environment for programs written in the UPC (Unified Parallel C) language. The GNU UPC compiler extends the capabilities of the GNU GCC compiler.

==Features
.UPC Language Specification version 1.3 compliant
.Based on GNU GCC
GPL licensed
Fast bit packed pointer-to-shared support
Configurable pointer-to-shared representation
Support for uniprocessor and symmetric multiprocessor systems
Runtime support for Infiniband based clusters with Portals 4.0 library support.
Support for many large scale machines and clusters in conjunction with Berkeley UPC runtime
Runtime support for UPC collectives
Runtime support for UPC thread affinity via Linux scheduling affinity and NUMA package
Runtime support for the UPC Atomic Memory Operations library defined in the UPC Specification version 1.3.
Runtime support for the UPC pointer-to-shared castability library defined in the UPC Specification version 1.3.
Runtime support for the UPC asynchronous shared memory bulk copy operations library defined in the UPC Specification version 1.3.
Runtime support for UPC thread backtrace
Runtime support for parallel debugging tools with MPIR capabilities
Runtime support for the STAT backtrace visualization tool
Binary packages for x86_64, ia64, i686
Binary packages for Linux Fedora, RHEL, SUSE, Ubuntu, CentOS, Mac OS X
